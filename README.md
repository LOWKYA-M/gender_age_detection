# gender_age_detect.ion
<h2>Objective :</h2
<p>To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture or through webcam.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p>In this Python Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. I used the models trained by <a href="https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html">Tal Hassner and Gil Levi</a>. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final softmax layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, I made this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.</p>
